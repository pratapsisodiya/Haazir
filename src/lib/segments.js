/**
 * Outreach variants. Each one is a real page — /jewellers, /clinics, /hotels,
 * /coaching — so a link you paste into a chat talks about that person's counter
 * instead of a generic "business".
 *
 * Everything brand-level (the wordmark, the headline, the palette) stays fixed.
 * What changes is the subhead, the thread the hero plays, and what the
 * calculator opens tuned to.
 *
 * `thread` is the scripted exchange the hero plays out. Each one
 * is written to end the same way on purpose: the agent answers, books, and then
 * hits something it should not decide — a discount, a diagnosis, a rate — and
 * hands over. That hand-off is the part that earns trust, so it is the part the
 * demo finishes on.
